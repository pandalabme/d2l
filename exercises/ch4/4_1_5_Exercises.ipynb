    "As the temperature parameter $\\alpha$ approaches 0, the softmax function approaches a step function. In the limit as $\\alpha$ goes to 0, the softmax function will assign all probability mass to the maximum element and zero probability to the other elements. This is because as $\\alpha$ becomes very small, the exponential term with the largest value will dominate the denominator, and all other terms will approach 0."

    "As the temperature parameter $\\alpha$ approaches $\\infty$, the softmax function becomes more uniform, and the probabilities for all elements tend to converge towards equal values. In this case, the output distribution approaches a uniform distribution, where all elements have roughly the same probability.\n",

    "In summary, adjusting the temperature parameter $T$ in the softmax function affects the shape and concentration of the resulting probability distribution. Higher values of $T$ \"soften\" the distribution, making it more uniform, while lower values \"sharpen\" the distribution, emphasizing the maximum value. As $T$ approaches 0, the distribution becomes more focused on the maximum value, and as $T$ approaches $\\infty$, the distribution becomes more uniform."
